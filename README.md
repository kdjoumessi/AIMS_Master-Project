# Bayesian Model selection with model evidence
This repository contains code for the simulations in our AIMS project titled 
- **Improve model selection through Brownian motion**

The code for this project is under the tag *model_evidence_simulation*.

### This code written in the SageMath software consists in simulating the high-dimensional integral which gives the model evidence in Bayesian model selection. In this code, to approximate this integral, we use the Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) and Jarzynski's equality (JE). We simulate it with different *gamma* parameter values and different *beta* protocols in order to choose the best parameter and protocol.
